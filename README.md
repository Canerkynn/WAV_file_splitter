# WAV_file_splitter

This script splits WAV files into 1 hour chunks, if a video is longer than 1 hour long.
The script also calculates sampling rate of each wav file, the length of each wav file,
and the total number of files and length of each directory being worked in. The script 
renames the new split folders using the parent name and a simple sequential numbering scheme.
